ENG_ensureourvictoryinthenavalarmsrace_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the naval arms race with the other Great Powers and the establishment of the two-power standard in 1898, we have spent huge amounts of money and resources into our naval construction. In the end we won the arms race, as no other power could afford to build as many ships as we can. However, we must ensure that remains as it is, with our Navy being the most powerful the world has ever seen. To accomplish that, we can expand our dockyards in Ireland and Canada."
