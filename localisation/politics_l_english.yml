 POLITICS_GEORGE_V_DESC:0 "George V, Emperor of the Imperial Federation, King of the Dominion of Iran and the Confederation of India. Born during the reign of his grandmother, Queen Victoria, George has seen nothing but prosperity and glory for his nation, a period of remarkable industrial, scientific progress and peace across the world. Since the beginning of his reign in 1910 he supported the idea of federalising of the British Empire and to bring an end to the colonial order. Something he achieved in the Imperial Confederation of 1911. He is known as the King of the people and father of the poor, because of the strong links established between him and his subjects across the globe, being the first monarch to have a coronation ceremony in India. He brought justice, equality and unseen economic growth to the Imperial Federation."

 POLITICS_GEORGE_VI_DESC:0 "George VI. 2nd Emperor of the Imperial Federation, King of Dominion of Iran and the Confederation of India. He wasn't supposed to be the King, but due to his brother's sudden death in 1935 he became the heir to his father, the beloved King of the people, his admiration for the achievements of his father in relinquishing the old colonial empire and turning it into a modern federation is enourmous. He looks forward to keep the stability and prosperity of the Imperial Federation, however he is aware of the threats of our time, with the mergence of expansionist communist republics across the globe and the United States with its hunger for territory at the expense of whoever is in it's path. It's up to him if the Imperial Federation will remain as the bastion of democracy protecting the world from tyranny once more."

 POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Kaiser Wilhelm II, the son of Wilhelm I who presided over the unification of the Fatherland in 1871. The German Emperor has been a symbol of discipline and stability for the German people, his agressive behaviour has been solved to a degree as he grew older and more experienced, he no longer seeks war with Russia or the Imperial Federation as long as Germany is not provoked. His reign saw the German Empire expand into colonial regions that were part of the falling French republic, peace and prosperity has been the only thing that the germans experienced in the 20th century, however socialist agitations across the world might put that to the test."

 POLITICS_PEDRO_III_DESC:0 "Emperor Dom Pedro III, 4th Emperor of Brazil, the great-grandson of Emperor Pedro II, the magnanimous. Dom Pedro III followed much of the example shown by his grandmother's reign in Brazil, focusing on trade protection and industrial expansion laws for economic growth as well as large resource extraction investments, which resulted in Brazil having one of the largest sources of raw materials in the world as well as a decent industry for industrial goods. Pedro seeks to improve the life standard in Brazil, specially in the poorest regions of the North, as well as create a golden age for Brazil and bring the Empire to the industrial might of the european Great Powers."
